### General Assessment

**1. Work Environment**
The environment at FCJ is truly dynamic and "tech-driven." The atmosphere always encourages curiosity and innovation. I was very impressed by how everyone discusses architecture solutions – there is no gap between "bosses" and interns; everyone focuses solely on finding the optimal solution for the problem.

**2. Support from Mentor / Team Admin**
The Mentors act less like teachers and more like Senior Cloud Engineers guiding a junior. When I encountered errors (e.g., unable to SSH into an EC2 instance or RDS connection failures), the Mentor didn't fix them for me immediately. Instead, they provided keywords and guided me on how to read logs in CloudWatch to debug it myself. Although this approach was challenging at first, it helped me understand the problems much more deeply. The Team Admin was also very enthusiastic in supporting AWS lab accounts so I wasn't interrupted during practice.

**3. Suitability of Work to Major**
As an IT student, participating in FCJ was the perfect piece to turn "Computer Networks" and "Operating Systems" theories into reality. Abstract concepts like IP and Subnet masks became tangible through configuring VPCs on AWS. This is a solid foundation for my career path as a System/DevOps Engineer.

**4. Learning Opportunities & Skill Development**
This is the part I value the most. From someone vague about the Cloud, I have mastered the core AWS services:
* **EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud):** Learned how to launch virtual servers, select appropriate instance types, and manage Security Groups.
* **VPC (Virtual Private Cloud):** Gained deep understanding of network architecture, dividing Private/Public Subnets, and configuring Route Tables and Internet Gateways.
* **S3 (Simple Storage Service):** Learned how to host static websites and manage bucket policy permissions.
* **IAM (Identity and Access Management):** Understood the importance of the "least privilege" principle when assigning permissions to users and roles.
* **RDS (Relational Database Service):** Learned how to deploy databases on the cloud and connect securely to the backend.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**
The "Share to learn" culture is very evident. Every week, the team holds small tech-talks to share new services or difficult case studies. Team spirit peaks when the whole group troubleshoots a deployment error together until late at night, but everyone is happy when the system runs successfully (Status check: 2/2 passed).

**6. Intern Policies / Benefits**
Besides the allowance, the most "profitable" thing for me was being granted access to the AWS Sandbox environment to experiment without fear of "bill shock." Internal documentation resources and training workshops are also invaluable knowledge benefits.


### Other Questions

- **What were you most satisfied with during your internship?**
It was the "aha!" moment when I successfully deployed a complete 3-tier architecture on AWS by myself, from the Load Balancer pointing to the Auto Scaling Group, down to the Database located in the Private Subnet. It proved that the knowledge I learned is practical and immediately applicable.

- **What do you think the company needs to improve for future interns?**
I think the program could introduce Infrastructure as Code (IaC) labs like Terraform or CloudFormation a bit earlier. While clicking through the Console is intuitive, it becomes quite time-consuming when re-doing tasks multiple times.

- **If you were to introduce this to friends, would you recommend interning here? Why?**
Definitely YES. FCJ is the ideal environment for those who want to start a career in Cloud/DevOps. You won't be assigned petty tasks; instead, you will be "immersed" in real projects and technologies.


### Suggestions & Wishes

- **Do you have any suggestions to improve the internship experience?**
There should be more "Mock Interview" sessions or guidance for AWS certifications (like SAA-C03) towards the end of the internship so that interns feel more confident when applying for official positions.

- **Do you want to continue this program in the future?**
I am very eager to continue accompanying FCJ, possibly as a Fresher or Junior Cloud Engineer, to continue conquering more advanced services like EKS or Serverless.

- **Other feedback (feel free to share):**
Thank you to the FCJ team for being patient and creating conditions for me to make mistakes and learn from them. This has been a truly memorable journey!
