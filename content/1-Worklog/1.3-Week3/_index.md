### Week 3 Objectives:

* Master EC2 compute services: Lifecycle, Storage (EBS/Instance Store), and Auto Scaling.
* Implement advanced connectivity using AWS Transit Gateway.
* Deploy scalable storage and content delivery solutions (S3 & CloudFront).
* Explore foundational AI/ML concepts (NLP, Sentiment Analysis) for the final project.
* Collaborate with the team to brainstorm and finalize the final project idea.
